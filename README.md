# READ ME

I had this idea that instead of using powerpoint while doing a presentation. I could just create a simple hugo theme that renders the markdown into a slideshow.

The site, in `config.toml` has a custom parameter called `active_presentation` - I just give it the path of my active presentation and that's it.

Whatever is in the markdown gets built on the homepage. That's it. I use the horizontal line as the separator between slides.

CSS only.
