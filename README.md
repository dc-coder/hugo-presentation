# READ ME

I had this idea that instead of using powerpoint while doing a presentation. I could just create a simple hugo theme that renders the markdown into a slideshow.

The theme has a custom parameter called `active_presentation` - I just give it the name of my active presentation.

Whatever is there gets built on the homepage. That's it.

CSS only.
